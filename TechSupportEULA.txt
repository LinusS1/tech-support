To use Tech Support, you must agree to this End User License Agreement.

By installing this app, you agree to this “agreement”. If this app was downloaded on to your computer by another person, both you and the other person agree to it (because you implicitly gave the other person permission to agree you to this EULA when you agreed the other person could install it)
Rules:
	▪	If you need help with a problem, you must use and complete the chart completely before calling someone.
	▪	Do not get angry when someone can’t help you/doesn’t want to
	▪	Do not wake someone up to help you.
	▪	Make an “honest effort” to figure out the problem.


This EULA is a joke. But the people you ask for support from may require that you follow it.
